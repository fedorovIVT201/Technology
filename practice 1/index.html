                    <p>Young Thug is an innovative trap artist who has shown his versatility from his signature rapping to crooning over pop type beats. Thug was born Jeffery Lamar Williams, an Atlanta rapper whose rise to popularity started in 2013 following the release of his first major hit, “Stoner.” He continued this streak in 2014 after being featured on multiple high-profile singles, including T.I.'s “About The Money” and Rich Gang’s “Lifestyle.”</p>

                    <p>Along with other Atlanta artists Gucci Mane and Future, Thug has an impressive work ethic dropping a series of mixtapes and albums, switching up his flow throughout his career.

                        Thug has been cited as an inspiration to legendary artists like Kanye West, who co-signed Thug, saying he’s like Bob Marley and featured Thug on his 2016 album The Life of Pablo on “Highlights.”
                        Young Thug received mainstream recognition in 2014 with the singles "Stoner" and "Danny Glover" in addition to appearances on several singles, including T.I.'s "About the Money", Tyga's "Hookah", and Rich Gang's "Lifestyle". That year, he also signed to Lyor Cohen's 300 Entertainment and collaborated on the mixtape Rich Gang: Tha Tour Pt. 1. In 2015, he amassed a number of mixtapes, including Barter 6 and two installments of his Slime Season series. Subsequently in 2016, Thug issued commercial mixtapes I'm Up, Slime Season 3, and Jeffery. In 2017, Thug featured on the worldwide hit "Havana" by Cuban pop singer Camila Cabello, which became his first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2018, he released a compilation album Slime Language with his discography YSL Records. In 2019, he won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for his contributions to Childish Gambino's "This Is America".</p>
